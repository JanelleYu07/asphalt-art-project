## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

   This project uses 4 files, NeighborhoodRunner, PainterPlus, BackgroundPainter, and SpidermanPainter.The BackgroundPainter is instantiated first to draw a white background across the whole board. Then, the SpidermanPainter is instantiated to draw the Spiderman face and body. 

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

   - I am proud that I was able to debug my coding errors with relative ease. 
   - I am also proud of how well the finished product resembles the actual character. 

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

   - I would like to use more methods to shorten my code to make less room for mistakes. For example, make a method that allows the painter to move a specific number of spaces with one line of code, instead of moving the painter only one space at a time.
